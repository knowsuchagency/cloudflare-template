/**
 * Fan-out tripwire.
 *
 * Why this test exists: a worker that calls itself in a loop (or a queue
 * consumer that re-publishes to its own queue, or a DO alarm that schedules
 * another alarm, ...) is invisible to Cloudflare's public-facing kill-switch
 * — nuking DNS, routes, custom domains, and workers.dev does nothing for
 * internal subrequests. See:
 *
 *   https://pizzaconsole.com/blog/posts/programming/cf-overage
 *
 * So protection has to live inside the worker. This template intentionally
 * does NOT prescribe a single safeguard pattern (hop-count headers, message
 * envelopes, alarm rate-limits, ...) — different fan-out shapes need
 * different mitigations. Instead this test fails the build the moment any
 * fan-out surface is added to wrangler.jsonc without an explicit reviewed-it
 * acknowledgment in REVIEWED below.
 *
 * When this test fails after you add a binding:
 *   1. Decide what stops a runaway loop for that surface (a hop-count
 *      header, a depth field on the queue message, a per-DO alarm budget,
 *      shared-secret + counter on the service binding, etc.).
 *   2. Add a REVIEWED entry below — the value is a one-line note pointing
 *      at the chosen safeguard and the test that exercises it.
 *   3. Add a behavioral test under test/safeguards/ that drives the
 *      surface end-to-end and asserts it terminates.
 *
 * When you remove a binding, delete the corresponding REVIEWED entry.
